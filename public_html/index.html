            We're proud to announce our newest outreach effort: the SAR Outreach Form. Our goal with this form is to
            empower common JSAers and give them the chance to have their voices heard. There are hundreds of problems
            within the MAS, and oftentimes SARs don't experience these problems firsthand, and, hence, don't think to
            write bills on these topics.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1000ms">
            Hence, we've created the SAR Outreach form. The form allows for everyday JSAers to submit their issues
            directly to the people that are writing legislation to fix issues within the MAS - the SARs. All responses
            will be viewable to the Speaker of the State Assembly, who will compile a list of the most pressing problems
            within the MAS and allow SARs to view this list.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1200ms">
            Our hope for the SAR outreach form is to not only motivate SARs to write more bills by giving them ideas
            to help them get started, but also to solve the problems that <span style = "color: #3495eb">all of you</span>
            everyday JSAers face. The State Assembly was created to solve the problems within MAS JSA, and we hope this form
            will help it to do that.

          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "800ms">
            This year, the State Assembly has completely revamped its publicity system, because we found it was almost
            completely ineffective in previous years. In fact, most JSAers don't realize that <u>
            contrary to popular belief, the State Assembly is open to everyone, not just SARs.</u>
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1000ms">
            Hence, on this site we have provided several resources, from the <b>State Assembly 101 Guide</b> for new SARs and
            new JSAers, to the <b>FEC Handbook</b> for rules about elections, to even the <b>archives</b> of previous bills.
            Our goal is to provide a level of communication and openness about the State Assembly that has been completely
            unseen in previous years.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1200ms">
            Finally, this year we will publish <u>comprehenseive meeting minutes for every State Assembly meeting</u>, so
            for new members looking to get involved or SARs that couldn't attend conventions, all the details of the meeting
            will still be easily accessible online.

          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "800ms">
            Our first goal this year is to move all meetings that can't be held in person to an online format.
            Given the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to ensure that whether or not an in person event
            is possible, we can still conduct State Assembly meetings.
          </h3>
          <h3 class = "reading-text animated wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay = "1000ms">
            Next, we plan on increasing bills written by SARs through an incentive program, as well as a general
            increased transparency and information through this website!
